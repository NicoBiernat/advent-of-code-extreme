# Collection of programming languages ordered by my experience
Languages in parentheses are the ones that I think are more difficult to solve the challenges with.  
They are not counted and also appear in the list of additional languages.  
[N]: Number of languages without parentheses  

## Good experience [5] (just start writing):
- [x] Java
- [ ] Go
- [ ] JavaScript
- [ ] Python
- [ ] Erlang
- (Scratch :D )

## Some experience [9] (used before, but need to google a lot):
- [ ] Haskell
- [ ] C
- [ ] Lua
- [ ] TypeScript
- [x] Bash
- [ ] C++
- [x] Pascal
- [ ] Scala
- (Prolog)
- [x] PHP
- (SQL)

## No experience [11] (but would be relatively easy to learn for the challenge):
- [x] C#
- [ ] Rust
- [x] Elixir
- [x] Nim
- [ ] Kotlin
- [x] Ruby
- [x] Dart
- [ ] Swift
- [ ] Julia
- [ ] F#
- [ ] Fortran

### Additional languages to consider [20]
- (Scratch)
- (Prolog)
- (SQL)
- (PL/SQL)
- Groovy
- R
- Scheme
- (APL)
- Lisp
- OCaml
- Perl
- (MATLAB) / Octave
- Objective-C
- Visual Basic

- (Assembly)
- (Logo)
- D 
- Ada

- some esoteric language
- some language that is accidentally or surprisingly turing complete but not actually designed for general purpose

### Bonus: Maybe use a complex framework instead of a new language
### Maybe on 6th and 24th? ;-)

#### Computing frameworks I have used before:

##### Java Batch/Stream Processing:
- [x] Kafka Streams
- [ ] Apache Flink
- [ ] Apache Hadoop MapReduce

##### C/C++ High-Performance-Computing:
- [ ] CUDA
- [ ] OpenCL
- [ ] GLSL Shader
