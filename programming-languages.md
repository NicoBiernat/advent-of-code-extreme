# Collection of programming languages ordered by my experience
Languages in parentheses are the ones that I think are more difficult to solve the challenges with.
[N]: Number of languages without parentheses

## Good experience [5] (just start writing):
- [ ] Java
- [ ] Go
- [ ] JavaScript
- [ ] Python
- [ ] Erlang
- [ ] (Scratch :D )

## Some experience [9] (used before, but need to google a lot):
- [ ] Haskell
- [ ] C
- [ ] Lua
- [ ] TypeScript
- [ ] Bash
- [ ] C++
- [x] Pascal
- [ ] Scala
- [ ] (Prolog)
- [ ] PHP
- [ ] (SQL)

## No experience [7] (but would be relatively easy to learn for the challenge):
- [x] C#
- [ ] Rust
- [x] Elixir
- [ ] Nim
- [ ] Kotlin
- [ ] Ruby
- [ ] Dart

### Current Plan: Use all of the above and the ones below with a <-

## No experience [3 + 6](but would probably more difficult to learn):
- [ ] Scheme <-
- [ ] LISP
- [ ] Fortran <-
- [ ] Julia
- [ ] R
- [ ] Swift <-
- [ ] Perl
- [ ] (MATLAB) / Octave
- [ ] Objective-C

### Bonus: Maybe use a complex framework instead of a new language
### Maybe on 6th and 24th? ;-)

#### Computing frameworks I have used before:

##### Java Batch/Stream Processing:
- [ ] Kafka Streams
- [ ] Apache Flink
- [ ] Apache Hadoop MapReduce

##### C/C++ High-Performance-Computing:
- [ ] CUDA
- [ ] OpenCL
- [ ] GLSL Shader
